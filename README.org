Wim (work in progress) is a modal text editing control, implemented in a web page.
It is the successor to [[https://github.com/hoosierEE/cred][cred]].

Everything below here is a desired (and maybe implemented) feature.

* Input
  Inspired by Vim and Spacemacs.

** modalities
   Rather than define the keyboard interface (Vim or Emacs style) at config time, Wim defaults to Emacs style while in Insert mode, and Vim style otherwise.

** other modes
   - shared clipboard
   - find-file
   - js-git integration
   - scripting/UI

* Display
  Wim renders text onto HTML5 canvas, with 1 canvas element per "buffer".
