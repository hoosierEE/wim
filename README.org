* Wim
Wim is a modal text editor Chrome app, similar to Vim, except:
- built using web tech (HTML, JS, CSS)
- kitchen sink versus "do one thing well"

** Input
Wim relies heavily on keyboard input and can be used without a mouse.  Supports most Vim commands and macros.

*** TODO editing modes
- normal
- insert (emacs-like key chords work in this mode)
- visual selction (normal, line-wise, block)

*** TODO other modes
- find-file
- js-git API
- scripting/UI

** TODO Output
Choose one:

1. HTML5 canvas (as long as crisp text works and is fast enough)
2. hidden textarea a'la CodeMirror, Ace, etc.
